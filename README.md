# Flashchain AI

⚠️ Note: Flashchain AI is currently in its early development stage. Core modules such as the miner, token distribution backend, and smart contract integrations are actively being built and improved.

We welcome early contributors, testers, and supporters to help shape the future of decentralized AI. This is just the beginning — and you’re here at the ground level.

Flashchain AI is a decentralized AI mining platform powered by Proof of Useful Work (PoUW) on Solana. Users earn FCAI tokens for solving real machine learning tasks with distributed hardware.

## Structure
- `miner/` – Python GPT-2 miner
- `server/` – Flask-based task distribution server
- `backend/` – Node.js backend for verifying payment and sending tokens
- `frontend/` – Wallet integration and payment UI
- `docs/` – Whitepaper, FAQ, and technical docs

## Quick Start
1. Clone the repo
2. Install dependencies in each module
3. Start the Flask task server
4. Run the miner to earn FCAI
5. Use backend to handle token distribution on SOL payment
